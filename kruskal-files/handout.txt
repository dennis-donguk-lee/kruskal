Implement Kruskal algorithm using disjoint sets.

Roadmap: 
1) implement disjoint sets (files disjoint_sets.h and disjoint_sets.cpp)
use driver_disjoint_sets.cpp (Makefile target gcc0_ds and msc0_ds). 
Master output is in ds-out0,...,ds-out10

2) implement Kruskal algorithm (file kruskal.h) using disjoint sets

Targets (see Makefile):
disjoint sets: gcc0_ds. msc0_ds. Executables are named same way. To test
gcc0_ds.exe test > student_test, where test is a number 0,....,10
compare student_test to master output out-ds...

kruskal: gcc0, msc0. Executables are named same way. 
Master output is in out0,out1,out2

Submit:
kruskal.h (no kruskal.cpp, so implementation goes into the header)
disjoint_sets.cpp
